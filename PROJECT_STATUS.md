# Tuya Local Control Integration Project Status

## Completed Tasks

1. **Core Implementation**
   - Created the basic structure for a Home Assistant custom integration
   - Implemented controller with entity-specific protocol version support
   - Added support for various entity types (switch, fan, light, number, sensor)
   - Created YAML configuration validation

2. **Tools and Utilities**
   - Created a discovery tool for finding Tuya devices
   - Implemented a protocol testing tool to determine optimal version
   - Developed a configuration tester to validate setup
   - Added a command-line interface for direct device control

3. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive README.md with usage instructions
   - Added detailed installation guide
   - Included example configurations
   - Created a contributing guide

4. **HACS Support**
   - Added hacs.json for HACS compatibility
   - Updated manifest.json with required fields

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test the integration with real Tuya devices
   - Verify that all entity types work correctly
   - Test protocol version switching with different device models

2. **Additional Features**
   - Consider adding more entity types (binary_sensor, climate, etc.)
   - Implement automatic protocol version detection
   - Add support for Tuya cloud API as fallback

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Enhance the config flow UI for easier setup
   - Add more diagnostics to the integration

4. **Release**
   - Create a repository for HACS distribution
   - Submit to the Home Assistant Community Store

## Known Issues

- Need to test with various Tuya device models
- Fan percentage conversion may need more fine-tuning
- Protocol version testing should include more versions

## How to Test

1. Install the integration in Home Assistant
2. Configure your devices with the example YAML
3. Use the discovery_tool.py to find your devices
4. Test protocol versions using protocol_test.py
5. Validate your configuration with config_tester.py
